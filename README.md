# App-Installer
An iOS app designed to allow you to install other (signed) iOS apps to your device.

#Purpose
If for some reason, you cannot access the App Store, but have access to the .ipa file, you can put it on a file sharing service and use the raw link to install it using App Installer. Also useful if you're jailbroken with AppSync Unified installed and want an easy way to install your IPAs.

#Issues
- Cannot install any apps because of SSL requirement for itms-services installations
